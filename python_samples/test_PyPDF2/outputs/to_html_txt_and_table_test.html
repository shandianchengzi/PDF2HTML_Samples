reset. 
0: Single conversion mode 1: Continuous conversion mode 
Bit 0 ADON : A/D converter ON / OFF
This bit is set and cleared by software. If this bit holds a value of zero and a 1 is written to it 
then it wakes up the ADC from Power Down state.
Conversion starts when this bit holds a value of 1 and a 1 is written to it. The application 
should allow a delay of t
STAB between power up and start of conversion. Refer to Figure 23.
0: Disable ADC conversion/calibration and go to power down mode.1: Enable ADC and to start conversion
Note: If any other bit in this register apart fr om ADON is changed at the same time, then 
conversion is not triggered. This is to  prevent triggering an erroneous conversion.Analog-to-digital converter (ADC) RM0008

Note: Unlike a regular conversion sequence, if JL[1:0] length is less than four, the channels 
are converted in a sequence starting from  (4-JL). Example: ADC_JSQR[21:0] = 10
